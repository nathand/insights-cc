# Insights Coding Challenge
## Dependencies
This was coded with Python 2.7. There shouldn't be any dependencies beyond standard python.
## How to run
Make sure run.sh is executable, and type `./run.sh`
## Run Notes
The script defaults to looking for `tweets.txt` in the `tweet_input` directory. A different file can be specified in `run.sh` by changing `TARGET_FILE` to any other text file in the input directory.
